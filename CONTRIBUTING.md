# Contributing Documentation to WorldWide Telescope

We would love for you to contribute to our repositories to make learning WWT easier for others and to help others get the most out of WWT. Here are some guidelines:

* [Contributing Agreement](contributing-agreement)
* [Question or problem?](question-or-problem)
* [How to Contribute](how-to-contribute)

## Contributing Agreement

By contributing, you agree that we may redistribute your work under our [license](LICENSE). Everyone involved in WorldWide Telescope agrees to abide by our [code of conduct](conduct.md).

## Question or Problem?
If you have a question or problem please post it to our (not yet existant) mailing list.

# How to Contribute
The easiest way to get started is to file an issue to tell us about a mistake, outdated documentation, some awkward wording, or missing documentation. This is a good way to introduce yourself and to meet some of our community members.

If you do not have or want a GitHub account, you can [send us comments by email](mailto:wwt@aas.org). However, we will be able to respond more quickly if you use one of the other methods described below.

If you have a GitHub account, or are willing to create one, but do not know how to use Git, you can report problems or suggest improvements by creating an [issue](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). This allows us to assign the item to someone and to respond to it in a threaded discussion.

If you are comfortable with Git, and would like to add or change material, you can submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/).

If you are working on part of the documentation please let others know so we minimize duplication of effort. Comment on an issue, open a new issue, or [send us an email](mailto:wwt@aas.org) letting everyone know what you're working on.

# Use of Gitbooks

All of our documentation is written in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) (with the file extension ```.md```) and rendered with [Gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com/). This means each repository has a ```SUMMARY.md``` table of contents file in addition to a ```README.md``` file that also serves as an introduction to the documentation.


### Acknowledgement
This document relied on both AngularJS' and Software and Carpentry's contributing documents.
