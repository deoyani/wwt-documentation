We would love for you to contribute to our repositories to make WWT easier for others to use and to help others get the most out of WWT. Here are some guidelines:

* Code of Conduct

* Feature request
* Mistaken, outdated, or missing documentation

## Code of Conduct
To be written... 

## Question or Problem?
If you have a question or problem please post it to our (not yet existant) mailing list.

## Feature Requests
Small feature requests can be opened as issues in the appropriate github repository. Larger feature requests should be posted to our (not yet existant) mailing list.

## Mistaken, outdated, or missing documentation
If you find a mistake in the documentation, or that it is outdated, or that there is a missing piece, you can help us by submitting an issue to the appropriate GitHub Repository. Even better you can submit a Pull Request with a fix. If you aren't sure which repository to chose, please open an issue to this repository or email us: wwt@aas.org.

If you are working on part of the documentation please let others know so we minimize duplication of effort. Comment on or open a new issue letting everyone know what you're working on.
